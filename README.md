# SQL Joins Tutorial

`Author: Sean Moser`
<br>
`Summary: This tutorial demonstrates how to run commands in Terminal utilizing the Docker application to connect to a MySQL container in order to query a simulated business's database. Left and right joins, grouping, aliases, database schema, and general query development are all discussed.`

This is a project for my IT1600, Digital Systems class, where I utilized the use of Visual Studio Code, Terminal, Docker, iMovie, and the SQL language to demonstrate how to use joins in order to query a database.
